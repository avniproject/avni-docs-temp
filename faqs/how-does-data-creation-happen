How does Avni handle data creation in modules?

In any module, Avni works strictly within the predefined schema. 
Data is created only when the user enters it.
Each module may include a subjectâ€™s registration, programs, and program encounters (or general encounter forms),
depending on how the subject type and programs are configured and what the user enters. Nothing is automatically generated.
