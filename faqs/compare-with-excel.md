| Feature                | Avni                                                                                 | Excel / Google Sheets                                                           |

| **Purpose**            | Purpose-built field data collection & case management tool                           | General-purpose spreadsheet for tabular data entry                              |
| **Offline Support**    | Offline-first Android app; syncs automatically when internet available                | Limited offline support; depends on local file or Google Sheets offline mode    |
| **Ease of Use in Field** | Mobile-friendly, guided forms, validations, skip logic, multilingual support         | Not optimized for fieldwork; manual entry prone to errors                      |
| **Data Validation**    | In-app rules, constraints, dropdowns, required fields, cross-form logic               | Basic validations (data types, dropdowns), but weak enforcement                 |
| **Workflow Management** | Tracks beneficiaries, follow-ups, program enrolments, scheduling, case management     | No workflow support; manual tracking required                                   |
| **Collaboration**      | Multiple field users, centralized server sync, role-based access                      | Possible via shared spreadsheets, but version conflicts & access issues common  |
| **Reporting**          | Dashboards, indicators, monitoring built-in                                           | Pivot tables, charts, formulas (requires manual setup)                         |
| **Scalability**        | Handles large-scale projects with many users and millions of records                  | Struggles with large datasets; performance issues as rows/columns increase      |
| **Security**           | Role-based access, audit logs, encrypted data                                         | Basic file protection; limited audit trails                                    |
| **Best For**           | NGOs & programs needing structured, reliable, field-ready data collection             | Small-scale projects or teams needing quick, ad-hoc tabular data entry          |
