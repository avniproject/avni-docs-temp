|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Open-source field service & case management platform (multi-sector)                    | Open-source survey/data collection tool focused on humanitarian/emergency use |
| **License**            | AGPL v3                                                                                | GPL v3                                                                        |
| **Hosting**            | Self-host or managed cloud                                                             | Free public server (hosted by Harvard/UN), self-hosting also possible         |
| **Offline Support**    | Offline-first Android app with reliable sync                                           | Offline data collection on Android; syncs when internet available             |
| **Ease of Use in Field** | Mobile-friendly, supports workflows, follow-ups, multilingual                         | Mobile forms for one-time surveys; simple and lightweight                     |
| **Data Validation**    | Strong: skip logic, rules, constraints, required fields, cross-form logic              | Supports skip logic and constraints, but limited for longitudinal tracking    |
| **Workflow Management** | Full case management: enrolments, follow-ups, visit scheduling, program tracking       | No case management; survey-based only                                         |
| **Collaboration**      | Role-based access, multiple field users, centralized sync                              | Data sharing via accounts or CSV export; simpler collaboration                |
| **Reporting**          | Built-in dashboards, indicators, monitoring tools                                      | Basic charts, maps, and exports; advanced analysis requires external tools    |
| **Scalability**        | Used in multi-year projects with millions of records and large teams                   | Best for small/medium surveys; struggles with long-term, large-scale programs |
| **Community**          | Smaller but focused community (health, development, governance)                        | Large humanitarian and academic user base                                     |
| **Best For**           | NGOs/governments needing structured, long-term program data & workflows                | Quick, survey-based data collection in humanitarian or research contexts      |
