## About Project Potential
[Project Potential](https://www.projectpotential.org/), based in Kishanganj, Bihar, was founded in 2014 with a vision to end poverty sustainably and inclusively in India’s poorest districts. The organization envisions enabling intergenerational social mobility by addressing systemic challenges in health, education, and employment.
To achieve its goals, Project Potential has actively worked to empower youth through skill development, employment opportunities, and solving critical community issues. Over the years, their efforts have created an impact on more than **7.5 lakh people**, transforming lives through innovative and community-driven solutions.

## About the Health Access Program
Every year, an estimated **6.3 crore Indians** fall below the poverty line due to high healthcare costs<sup>1</sup>, despite government programs like universal health insurance and maternal support schemes.
In Bihar, **36% of the population** faces multidimensional poverty, struggling with inadequate healthcare, poor education, and low living standards. This translates to a staggering population of over **4 crore** people in need of urgent interventions.
To address the financial burden of healthcare, the Government of India introduced the **Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)**, providing health coverage of **₹5,00,000 per family per year** for secondary and tertiary care. Despite its benefits, the lack of awareness and infrastructure has hindered many eligible individuals from registering for this life-changing scheme.

To overcome these challenges, Project Potential has launched an integrated implementation system aimed at increasing access to health schemes like **Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PMJAY)** across the Kishanganj district. Starting with **Thakurganj, Pothia, and Bahadurganj** blocks, the project focuses on awareness campaigns and end-to-end processes, from registration to card distribution.

### Key Achievements:
- Access to health cards has been provided to over **20,000 beneficiaries** so far.
### Goals and Targets:
- Building a PMJAY model panchayat in Besarbati (Thakurganj Block), targeting 100% health card enrollment for over 10,000 eligible beneficiaries providing benefits worth over Rs 100 crores.
- Extending impact to 5,000 beneficiaries in the adjacent Bhatgaon Panchayat.

## Why Digitization is Needed
In today’s data-driven world, reliable and accessible information is the cornerstone of effective decision-making—especially in healthcare. The paper-based system along with the limited use of Google Forms, which we were using for tracking healthcare access and beneficiary data, were often prone to errors, duplication, and inefficiency. These limitations resulted in missed opportunities to connect eligible individuals with vital health schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PMJAY).

Digitization transforms these challenges into opportunities by streamlining data collection, ensuring real-time accessibility, and enhancing accuracy. In Kishanganj, one of India’s poorest regions, healthcare gaps are significant, making digital solutions indispensable for bridging the divide between policy and practice. By embracing digitization, we ensure that every eligible beneficiary can access the benefits they are entitled to.

## Exploring Tools for Digitization
Before choosing Avni, we explored other tools for digitization. However, most options were either too rigid to adapt to our needs of working offline or required expensive customization. Avni stood out for its open-source nature, flexibility, and user-friendly design, allowing seamless integration with program requirements.

## Why Avni?
The Avni platform was selected for its open-source platform, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Key reasons include:

1. **Customizability for Local Needs:** Seamlessly integrates with processes like PMJAY’s eKYC, tracking card printing, and ensuring card distribution to beneficiaries.
2. **Offline Functionality:** Ensures uninterrupted data collection even in areas with limited internet access.
3. **Data Analytics:** Provides actionable insights to identify healthcare gaps and prioritize interventions effectively.
4. **Multilingual Support:** Avni’s availability in Hindi and English makes it accessible to on-ground teams, facilitating smooth operations.

Key features tailored for this implementation included scheduled follow-up visits to beneficiaries, households with reminders, offline report cards and longitudinal reports to track the progress at the individual field coordinators’ level, and customized  dashboards using the integrated metabase platform for tracking the program’s progress

## Self-Servicing Avni
We adopted a self-service mode to implement Avni, **empowering** us to operate the platform without depending on external consultants. This approach ensures:
- **Sustainability:** Internal capacity-building enables long-term scalability.
- **Local Ownership:** Greater accountability and community involvement in implementation.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for costly external implementation teams.

## Experience of Self-Servicing Avni
The journey of self-servicing Avni demonstrated how focused training, determined effort, and collaboration can lead to transformative change within a short span and with minimal resources.

**Training and Empowerment:** Over the course of six intensive training sessions held within three weeks, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the Avni platform. This hands-on learning equipped me with the skills needed to independently set up, configure, and adapt the system, significantly boosting my confidence and ensuring I could manage the platform effectively.

**Strong Support from the Samanvay Team for a Quick Rollout:** The training, coupled with dedicated support from the Samanvay team, enabled us to take the solution live within a month. This collaborative effort ensured an efficient and cost-effective rollout, proving that even with limited resources, it’s possible to achieve significant outcomes.

**Community Adaptation:** Transitioning from being trained to training others with limited exposure to digital tools required a strategically planned approach. The platform was piloted and tested multiple times to ensure its reliability. After fine-tuning it to meet the practical needs of program managers, field coordinators, panchayat coordinators, data operators, and ward mobilizers, the platform was ready for field implementation. This step ensured that the system was both relevant and user-friendly, enabling seamless data-driven decision-making.

## Impact Story: Changing Lives Through Health Cards
One such story is of Ram, a 50-year-old resident of Hathiduba village of Besarbati Panchayat. He had been suffering from chronic health issues but could not afford treatment. During a health card registration drive, Ram’s family was registered under PMJAY using Avni. Within weeks, he underwent heart surgery at a hospital in Patna with 2 lakh utilisation from Ayushman card. Today, Ram is healthy and grateful for the access to quality healthcare that was made possible through this initiative. His story is a testament to the life-changing potential of digitised healthcare access.
