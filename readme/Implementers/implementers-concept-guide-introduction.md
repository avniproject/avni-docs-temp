      title: Avni's domain model of field based work
---
Implementer's concept guide is for anyone who would like to implement Avni for any field-based program. We recommend this guide to be the first one to be read by anyone wanting to understand Avni.

While internally there are many parts of the system, if you are an implementer and using the hosted instance then these are the components you will be using. Some of the functions are intended for the end-users but you will use them for testing the application.
