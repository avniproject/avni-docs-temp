title: Upload local database
excerpt: ''
Many times, the local database of the Android app provides clues to an issue happening on that device. Avni provides a mechanism to send a backup of the local database to Avni so that a developer can recreate this issue and perform fixes if required. 

To upload your local database, go to the "More" section on the home page and press on the "Upload Database" menu item.
