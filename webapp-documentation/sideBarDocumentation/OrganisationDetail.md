You can delete all the data that is filled using the field app. Also if you select to delete metadata, it'll delete all the forms and concept that you had created using web application.

**Please note that DELETE ALL DATA action is irreversible, so choose the options very carefully**

Several organisation-wide changes can be enabled from here.

`Approval Workflow`: Enabling this will allow you to approve/reject all the forms filled by the field users. You'll need to create a [custom dashboard](#/appdesigner/dashboard) and also adjust the [privileges](#/admin/userGroups) accordingly.

`Draft Save`: Enabling this feature will enable saving the registration form automatically on every press of next button. All the drafts are available on the register page.

`Enable Messaging`: Enabling this will introduce the capability of sending messages through Whatsapp. Remember that there is more configuration required for this integration to work.
