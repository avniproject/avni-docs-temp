Your service area is a hierarchy of different locations (eg: district, taluka, village). Here, we define the different location types that are required for your program to run.

**Example**: In State -> District -> City hierarchy
<br>City is level 1, District is level 2 and parent of City, State is level 3 and parent of District.

All Subjects are associated with Locations. The field app requires you to provide this location to the lowest level available in the system.

**Uploading Locations**

You can also upload locations using the Upload screen. This option will automatically create Location Types.
