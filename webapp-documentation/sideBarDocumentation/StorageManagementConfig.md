This feature enables configuration of a custom SQL query which is used to determine which subjects' records should be excluded from syncing to the Avni mobile app. This helps to reduce storage usage on mobile devices and the time taken to sync the records.

The SQL query should only return the IDs of subjects whose data needs to be excluded from syncing. Refer to [the documentation for this feature](https://avni.readme.io/docs/app-storage-management-and-sync-disable) for additional details.
