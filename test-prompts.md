3. How do I add or remove a new field to an existing form?  
ANS - Fields can be added to forms through the App Designer. You can reach the form through different means. 
1. Go to App Designer > Forms > Select the form
2. Go to App Designer > Subject Types, Programs or Encounter Types > Select the form you need to edit
3. Navigate to the section/page you wish to add the field to. If required, add a new section/page As you hover over the left portion, you will see a + button. Click on it to add a new field. 

Each Form field has a few components. 
1. Question - This is what shows up in your form
2. Concept - This is the internal name of the field. It is also shown in patient dashboards, reports etc. Normally, we keep the name of the concept to be the same as the question. Remember that there can only be one concept with a certain name in the entire system. Also, a concept can be used only once in a form.
